### 1) What is containerization?

Containerization is an application-centric method to deliver high-performing and scalable applications. It involves encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a single unit called a container. This container can then run consotently across different computing environments. It solves the common problem of "it works on mine, so why doesnt it work on yours?".

A key componont associated with containers is a container image. This is a package containing the application code and its dependencies. It represents the source of the container to offer an isolated executable environment for the application.

### 2) Compare the pros and cons of deploying Jenkins using a pre-built AMI (such as 
Bitnami package for Jenkins) vs defining and deploying a custom docker image?
